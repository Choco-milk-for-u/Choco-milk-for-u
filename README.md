# Hi!
## i am _MERN-STACK_ (full-stack) web developer. Currently searching for job (back-end position prefered). Also i am studing in Georgian Tehnology Universitet almost 2 years. I dont have gaps in activity, i just dont really use github (lately try to fix that). In my portfilio you can find all my done projects (pdf or linkedin).
